# Cortex

**Memory infrastructure for AI agents that actually remembers.**

Cortex gives your AI agents persistent memory with automatic extraction of beliefs, learnings, entities, and commitments. It's like giving your AI a brain that learns and grows with every conversation.

## What makes Cortex different?

Most memory systems just store and retrieve text. Cortex goes further:

- **Cognitive Memory** - Automatically extracts beliefs, learnings, and preferences from conversations
- **Knowledge Graph** - Builds entity relationships and tracks how they evolve over time
- **Proactive Intelligence** - Generates nudges, relationship health scores, and commitment tracking
- **Time Travel** - Query what was true at any point in time, not just now

## Quick Example

```typescript
import { CortexClient } from '@cortex/memory';

const cortex = new CortexClient({ apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY' });

// Store a memory
await cortex.memories.create({
  content: "User mentioned they're switching from React to Vue for their next project",
  source: "chat"
});

// Cortex automatically extracts:
// - Belief: "User prefers Vue over React for new projects"
// - Entity: "React" (technology, mentioned negatively)
// - Entity: "Vue" (technology, mentioned positively)
// - Learning: "User is exploring new frontend frameworks"

// Later, recall context
const context = await cortex.recall({
  query: "What frontend framework should I recommend?",
  includeProfile: true
});
// Returns: User prefers Vue, has React experience, exploring new options
```

## Core Concepts

- **Memories** - Raw information stored with automatic processing
- **Beliefs** - Stable facts about the user extracted from memories
- **Learnings** - Insights and patterns discovered over time
- **Entities** - People, places, things with tracked relationships
- **Commitments** - Promises and obligations with due dates

## SDKs

- [TypeScript](/sdks/typescript) - `npm install @cortex/memory`
- [Python](/sdks/python) - `pip install cortex-memory`
- [MCP Server](/sdks/mcp) - Works with Claude Desktop, Cursor, and other MCP clients
