## Introduction

Cortex is your personal AI memory assistant that helps you capture, organize, and recall everything important in your life. By connecting to your Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Drive, Cortex creates a searchable second brain that learns your patterns and helps you stay on top of commitments, relationships, and decisions.

We take your privacy seriously and are committed to being transparent about how we use your data.

---

## Information We Collect

With your explicit permission, Cortex accesses the following:

**Gmail:** Email metadata and content to extract important information, track commitments, identify follow-ups, and create memories from your communications.

**Google Calendar:** Your event history, upcoming events, and free time slots to help with smart rescheduling, meeting preparation, and time optimization.

**Google Drive:** Document metadata to help you recall and reference important files in context.

**Voice & Text Input:** Memories you create through voice recordings or text input are processed and stored to build your personal knowledge base.

**Photos:** Images you choose to attach to memories for visual context and recall.

**Device Info:** Device type, OS version, push notification tokens, and anonymous usage logs for debugging, performance tracking, and delivering notifications.

**Location (Optional):** With your permission, your location to provide context-aware memories and personalized suggestions based on where you are.

### We do NOT:

- Access your contacts without consent
- Read your emails without purpose
- Sell or share your data with third parties
- Take actions without explicit user consent
- Train AI models on your personal data

## How We Use Your Data

We use your data to:

- **Capture and organize memories** from your conversations, emails, and calendar events
- **Enable semantic search** so you can find any memory using natural language
- **Extract and track commitments** you've made to others and others have made to you
- **Provide meeting preparation** briefs with relevant context before your meetings
- **Smart reschedule** your calendar based on your preferences and energy patterns
- **Surface insights** about your time allocation, relationships, and patterns
- **Send proactive reminders** about important follow-ups, birthdays, and commitments
- **Learn from your preferences** to improve Cortex's suggestions over time

All actions are shown transparently in the app — you're always in control.

## Data Storage & Security

### Third-Party Integrations

All third-party integrations (Gmail, Calendar, Drive) are facilitated via **Composio**, a SOC 2-certified platform that handles authentication and data access on behalf of Cortex.

- Authentication is securely handled via Google OAuth through Composio
- Data retrieval and action execution (e.g., sending emails, creating events) occur through temporary authorized sessions

### Data We Store

Unlike session-only access, Cortex stores certain data to provide its core memory functionality:

- **Memories:** Text content, summaries, and metadata of memories you create or that are extracted from your connected services
- **Embeddings:** Vector representations of your memories for semantic search (these cannot be reverse-engineered to reveal original content)
- **User Preferences:** Your notification settings, timezone, and app preferences
- **Relationship Data:** Information about people you interact with, extracted from your memories to provide relationship intelligence

### Security Measures

- All data is encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3) and at rest (AES-256)
- Database access is restricted and monitored
- We perform regular security audits
- We do not store your Google OAuth tokens — these are managed securely by Composio

### What We Don't Do

- We do not train AI models on your personal data
- We do not sell or share any user data with third parties
- We do not access your data for advertising purposes
